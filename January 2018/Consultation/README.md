To be completed
Before our session on Friday, January 12 (and perhaps even before the institute begins), please read<a href="http://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/16833/18427"> Beyond buttonology: Digital humanities, digital pedagogy, and the ACRL Framework</a>, by JE Russell and MK Hensley. This article serves as a framework to how we've developed the ARL Digital Scholarship Institute, will provide some food for thought when engaging in Friday morning's activities, and makes a nice connection between the ACRL Framework that instruction librarians know well and how we might approach digital pedagogy moving forward.
