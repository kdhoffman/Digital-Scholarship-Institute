Please read this article in preparation for our workshop on digital consultations (for research or pedagogy) - [Beyond buttonology: Digital humanities, digital pedagogy, and the ACRL Framework] (https://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/16833/18427). This can be a quick, interesting read while you travel, can provide some food for thought prior to the Aug 3 workshop, and is sure to resonate with librarians who have been working to incorporate the ACRL Framework into their teaching practice.


Participants will . . . 
- brainstorm investigative questions, given a pedagogy or consultation scenario in order to internalize the multiple factors and considerations that go into planning for a digital scholarship endeavor
- recall the tools, methodologies, and scholarly concepts of the week-long institute upon which to base their questions in order to consider the possible directions a project can take, whether limited or expansive in scope
- name key collaborators from within the library and across campus that could be essential to a projectâ€™s success in order to understand the nature and scope of multiple talents and skill sets needed to undertake a project
